[Employee- Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VP9BE_eI2yl6uUHSm4mGiiwjRdoqCqnkcIjsv5Q2ex4/edit?usp=share_link)


This program is designed to perform data analysis and visualisation on an employee dataset.
The program starts by importing the necessary libraries: Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn for the data visualisation.
The program performs the following tasks:

# Distribution of employees across teams: 
It calculates the number of employees in each team and corresponding percentage split relative to the total number of employees. The results are displayed in the console, and a bar chart is plotted to visualise the distribution.

# Segregation by position: 
The program segregates the employees based on their position within the company, It displays the count of employees for each position and visualises the distribution using a pie chart. 

# Predominant age group: 
The program identifies the predominant age group among the employees by grouping them into age ranges (eg. 20-30,30-40,40-50....etc), The predominant age group is displayed and histogram is plotted to visualise the age distribution.

# Salary Expenditure: 
The program determines the team and the position with the highest salary expenditure by grouping and summing the salaries for each team and position.

# Age â€“ Salary correlation: 
The program investigates the correlation between age and salary by creating a scatterplot using the seaborn library. The scatterplot visualises the relationship between an employees age their corresponding salaries. Throughout the analysis, the program makes use of various data manipulation and visualisation techniques provided by the pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries. Visualisations are displayed using the matplotlib.pyplot library, allowing for a better understanding and interpretation of the data

Overall, the program provides insights into the dataset analysing various aspects such as team distribution, positions, age group, salary expenditure and the correlation between age and salary. The results are presented through both tabular and graphical formats for easier comprehension.
